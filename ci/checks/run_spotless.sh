# pre-commit hook wrapper that runs 'spotless:apply' to format the Java sources of every Maven
# project under java/.
#
# Most cuvs contributors do not work on the Java client and do not have Maven installed. For them
# (running outside CI without Maven) this skips gracefully, so that 'pre-commit run --all-files'
# does not require every contributor to install Maven. In CI, Maven is expected to be available and
# its absence is treated as an error.
